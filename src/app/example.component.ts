    // Each of them within their respective icon npm packages are exported as faUser,
    // but we've renamed the second one in order to disambiguate the two objects within
    // this JavaScript module. Internally, these objects are different, even though they have the same iconName.
    // They have different prefixes: faUser has a prefix of fas, since it came from free-solid-svg-icons;
    // regularUser has a prefix of far, since it came from free-regular-svg-icons.
    // And of course, they also have different SVG content, resulting in different appearances.
    // So they really are totally different icons. However, they share the same iconName: user.
    // So in the template, the only way to reference the non-default (fas) icon is to either
    // use the array syntax that specifies [prefix, iconName], like this:
    //
    // <fa-icon [icon]="['far','user']"></fa-icon>
    //
    // Or we could make the regularUser object available to the template and simply
    // reference it as an object, like this:
    //
    // <fa-icon [icon]="regularUser"></fa-icon>
    //
    // You don't specify the prefix in that case, because the icon object knows its own prefix.
    library.add(faUser, regularUser);
