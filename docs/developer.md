## How to Help

Review the following docs before diving in:

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/FortAwesome/angular-fontawesome/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/FortAwesome/angular-fontawesome/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

And then:

1. Write more tests like those in `icon.component.spec.ts` to increase our test coverage and submit pull requests.

2. If you are an experienced Angular developer, after experimenting with this component, provide feedback about what refinements might help it feel more like an "Angular" way of doing things. Open a new issue with each distinct recommendation, or submit a pull request with your suggested revisions.
