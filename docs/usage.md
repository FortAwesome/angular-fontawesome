# Usage

## Approaches
There are two approaches for using `angular-fontawesome`. Each has its own pros and cons, so we leave it to you to decide how you'd like to use the library.

* [Explicit Reference](./usage/explicit-reference.md)
* [Icon Library](./usage/icon-library.md)

Whichever approach you choose only the icons you have imported will end up in the bundle, and the remaining ones will be tree-shaken away.
