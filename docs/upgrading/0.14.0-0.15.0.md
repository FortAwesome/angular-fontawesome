# Upgrading 0.14.0 to 0.15.0

## Remove usage of the `spin` and `pulse` inputs

Previously deprecated `spin` and `pulse` inputs in all components were removed. The usage should be replaced with a generic `animation` input which supports more animations. See [Animating icons](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/style/animate) for a reference.

Dynamic animation can be achieved by binding the `animation` input to `undefined`:

```diff
- <fa-icon [icon]="['fas', 'sync']" [spin]="isSyncAnimated" (click)="isSyncAnimated=!isSyncAnimated"></fa-icon>
+ <fa-icon [icon]="['fas', 'sync']" [animation]="isSyncAnimated ? 'spin' : undefined" (click)="isSyncAnimated=!isSyncAnimated"></fa-icon>
```

## Remove usage of the `styles` and `classes` inputs

Previously deprecated `styles` and `classes` inputs in all components were removed. These inputs don't work the way one would expect and cause a lot of confusion. For the majority of the cases, one should use regular [class and style bindings](https://angular.io/guide/class-binding) provided by Angular. For those rare cases, when it is not enough, there is a guide on how one can style component's internal elements at their own risk - [Styling icon internals](https://github.com/FortAwesome/angular-fontawesome/blob/master/docs/guide/styling-icon-internals.md).
