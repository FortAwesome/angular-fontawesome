# Upgrading 0.14.0 to 0.15.0

## Remove usage of the `spin` and `pulse` inputs

Previously deprecated `spin` and `pulse` inputs in all components were removed. The usage should be replaced with a generic `animation` input which supports more animations. See [Animating icons](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/style/animate) for a reference.

Dynamic animation can be achieved by binding the `animation` input to `undefined`:

```diff
- <fa-icon [icon]="['fas', 'sync']" [spin]="isSyncAnimated" (click)="isSyncAnimated=!isSyncAnimated"></fa-icon>
+ <fa-icon [icon]="['fas', 'sync']" [animation]="isSyncAnimated ? 'spin' : undefined" (click)="isSyncAnimated=!isSyncAnimated"></fa-icon>
```
