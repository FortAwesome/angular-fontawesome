# Upgrading 0.11.0 to 0.12.0

## Remove usage of the deprecated `styles` and `classes` inputs

`styles` and `classes` inputs in all components are deprecated for removal in the next release. These inputs don't work the way one would expect and cause a lot of confusion. For majority of the cases, one should use regular [class and style bindings](https://angular.io/guide/class-binding) provided by Angular. For those rare cases, when it is not enough, there is a guide on how one can style component's internal elements at their own risk - [Styling icon internals](https://github.com/FortAwesome/angular-fontawesome/blob/master/docs/guide/styling-icon-internals.md).
