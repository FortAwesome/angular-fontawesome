# Upgrading 0.9.0 to 0.10.0

## Migrate from global icon library to FaIconLibrary

Support for the deprecated icon library from `@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core` (referred as *global icon library*) was removed together with the corresponding deprecated configuration property (`FaConfig.globalLibrary`). Make sure to remove any usage of the above prior to upgrading.

See the [deprecation announcement](https://github.com/FortAwesome/angular-fontawesome/blob/master/docs/upgrading/0.4.0-0.5.0.md#migrate-from-global-icon-library-to-faiconlibrary) for more details.
